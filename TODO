- Remove uneeded abs calls
- Keep selected grids on reset ('0')
- Add option to show gnomonic compute grid
- Add menu for selecting a predefined region :-)
- Add back option for saving to png file
- Determine if we need corner lat/lon option when plotting GRIB
- Output args for recreating the plot (on 'y' press) and make
  it so that it can be copy-pasted as one of the default grids.
  Eventually, we can add an option to "save" as predefined. ;-)
