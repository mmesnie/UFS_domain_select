==========
SPACK TODO
==========

1. Test current recipe and create do-all script -

. ./build-stack-spack (automate "spack edit fms"; ~/.spack/package_repos/fncqgg4/repos/spack_repo/builtin/packages/fms/package.py)
./build-model-spack 2.2.0 (be clear on model version; 2.2.0 vs. 3.0.0)
./install-anaconda
./config-anaconda
conda activate regional_workflow-2.2.0; ./install-plotting
./download-earth
./download-data 2.2.0
./do-forecast-spack 2.2.0
./do-post 2.2.0
./do-plot

-Is Anaconda needed to build the model??
-Is regional_workflow-2.2.0 only needed for UFS_domain_select?

==========
Other TODO
==========
  - check for python version with wrapper (python via workflow_tools is too old)
  - experiment with all-in-one distribution
  - pip install h5py (be sure to "conda activate regional_workflow-2.2.0")
  - resolve "leonard" for data download
  - Reintegrate Makefile that downloads the data, please!

========
GUI TODO
========

--> see ~/UFS_domain_select/build/ufs-srweather-app-v2.2.0/parm/data_locations.yml (line 120)
--> add GUI option for date and such
--> create "latest" option for date and such
--> Zooming in on Global should change it to regional!
--> InterruptedGoodeHomolosine shifts on center
--> InterruptedGoodeHomolosine creeps on set
--> Look into draw vs. show

- Remove uneeded abs calls
- Keep selected grids on reset ('0')
- Add option to show gnomonic compute grid
- Add menu for selecting a predefined region :-)
- Add back option for saving to png file
- Determine if we need corner lat/lon option when plotting GRIB
- Output args for recreating the plot (on 'y' press) and make
  it so that it can be copy-pasted as one of the default grids.
  Eventually, we can add an option to "save" as predefined. ;-)
