==========
Build TODO
==========

- "python" missing, initially
- Automate source ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh + spack edit fms
- Resolve "leonard" for data download
- Experiment with all-in-one distribution (so conda isn't needed)
- Reintegrate Makefile that downloads the data, please!
- pip install h5py? (be sure to "conda activate regional_workflow-2.2.0")

========
GUI TODO
========

--> see ~/UFS_domain_select/build/ufs-srweather-app-v2.2.0/parm/data_locations.yml (line 120)
--> add GUI option for date and such
--> create "latest" option for date and such
--> Zooming in on Global should change it to regional!
--> InterruptedGoodeHomolosine shifts on center
--> InterruptedGoodeHomolosine creeps on set
--> Look into draw vs. show

- Remove uneeded abs calls
- Keep selected grids on reset ('0')
- Add option to show gnomonic compute grid
- Add menu for selecting a predefined region :-)
- Add back option for saving to png file
- Determine if we need corner lat/lon option when plotting GRIB
- Output args for recreating the plot (on 'y' press) and make
  it so that it can be copy-pasted as one of the default grids.
  Eventually, we can add an option to "save" as predefined. ;-)
